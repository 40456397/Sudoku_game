This is my Sudoku game for my Data Science / Algorithms and Data Structures coursework.

This is a Sudoku game, written in Python and played in the Command window.

To load the game, save the code in a file named 'sudoku_game.py', then open the Command window and enter 'python sudoku_game.py'.

There were some features I didn't get to add, such as a 4th level of difficulty, a leaderboard, and the ability to save and replay an entire game.
